This is the final project for Early College Course EDCU 212 for Non-Coders.
From Guyliano Julmis at TechBoston Academy.


My project is a Scratch game about going on a school field trip to a go-kart track. The game starts at a school where a bus picks up students. The bus drives on the highway and then arrives at the go-kart track. After the intro, the player controls a go-kart and races through three levels. When the player finishes level 3, the game shows a win screen.

I used different Scratch blocks to make my game work.
I used events and broadcasts to start the bus intro and switch scenes.
I used backdrops to show the school, highway, go-kart track, levels, and win screen.
I made a variable called level to keep track of what level the player is on.
When the backdrop changes, the level variable changes to match the level.
I used the arrow keys to move the go-kart.
I used touching color blocks to detect checkpoints and the finish line.
The win screen only shows when the player finishes level 3.
I added sounds for the bus engine and stopping to make the game more realistic.
I used loops to make the bus and go-kart move smoothly.
